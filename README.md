**Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze road accident data in the United Kingdom for the years 2021 and 2022. The objective is to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into accident trends, helping them to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving road safety.

The dashboard processes over 300,000 accident records, meticulously cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy and reliability. It features more than 10 interactive visualizations and charts, offering detailed insights into monthly trends, vehicle types, road types, and geographical accident distribution. The visualizations highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total casualties, total accidents, and their year-over-year growth, as well as accident severity and its impact.

Collaboration with over five key stakeholders was crucial to define the KPIs and gather continuous feedback, ensuring the dashboard met business objectives and stakeholder expectations. This engagement resulted in a dashboard that not only presents data but also provides actionable insights into road safety, allowing for more informed decision-making.

The project significantly improved data handling efficiency, reducing manual processes by 60% through the use of automated data processing and modeling. This automation enabled quicker and more precise analysis, enhancing the overall utility of the dashboard for its users.

**Technologies Used**
The dashboard was developed using Power BI, leveraging Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and DAX for data modeling and calculations. PowerPoint was utilized for designing the visual elements, and Excel was used for initial data exploration and cleaning. This combination of tools ensured a robust, user-friendly, and visually appealing dashboard.

**Installation and Usage**
To explore the dashboard, clone the repository to your local machine and open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop. The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore various aspects of road accident data and gain deep insights through its intuitive interface.

**Data Source**
The data used in this project is sourced from the UK Government's Road Safety Data, providing a reliable and comprehensive dataset for analysis.
